# Azure AI Chat Demo

A Python chat application demonstrating integration with the Azure AI Foundry SDK.  

This project shows how to connect a Python client to a deployed GPT model, handle conversation context, and implement safe credential management using environment variables.

**Note:** The project uses a `.env` file for sensitive information (API keys, endpoints) which should **never be committed**. An example file `.env.example` is included for reference.
